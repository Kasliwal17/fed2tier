****************

`CodeCarbon <https://github.com/mlco2/codecarbon>`_ is a Python package that provides an estimation of the carbon emissions associated with software code. It can be integrated into software development workflows and offers real-time feedback on the environmental impact of the code being developed. CodeCarbon helps developers and organizations become more environmentally conscious by optimizing their code and making better choices regarding the hardware and infrastructure used to run it. It enables companies to achieve their sustainability goals and demonstrate their commitment to reducing their environmental impact.

To estimate the carbon emissions generated by clients during training, CodeCarbon has been utilized in the client_lib.py file, located in the client/src/ directory. By default, the client's location is set to India, but it can be modified to reflect the client's actual location. The following code snippet illustrates how CodeCarbon is used in the client_lib.py file:
